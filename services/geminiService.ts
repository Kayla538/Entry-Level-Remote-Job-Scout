      3.  The jobs MUST be entry-level and 100% remote for US residents.

      Job Lead:
      - Job Title: "${lead.jobTitle}"
      - Company: "${lead.companyName}"

      **Verification Protocol:**
      1.  **Search:** Use your search tools to locate the specific job posting on the company's official careers page or a major, reputable job board (like LinkedIn, Indeed, Greenhouse, Lever). Prioritize the most recently posted version of this job.
      2.  **Verify Liveness:** Before you conclude, you MUST confirm the URL is a direct link to an ACTIVE job posting. A live page will show the job description and an application button. If the page says "Job no longer available," "This position has been filled," or shows a 404 error, the link is DEAD.
      3.  **URL Quality Control:** The URL must be the final destination.
          -   **DO NOT** return internal search result URLs (e.g., links starting with \`https://www.google.com/search?q=...\`).
          -   **DO NOT** return links to a list of jobs; it must be the link to the specific job.
          -   **DO NOT** return a URL that requires a login just to view the job description.

      **Output Format:**

      *   **If you find a valid, live application page:**
          Return ONLY a single, clean JSON object with these exact keys. No extra text or markdown.
          -   "applyUrl": The direct, live URL to the job application page.
          -   "jobDescription": A concise summary of the job's core responsibilities and qualifications.
          -   "datePosted": How long ago the job was posted (e.g., "Posted 2 days ago"). If a date is not available, use "Recently posted".
          -   "employmentType": The type of employment. Analyze the job description for terms like 'full-time', 'contract', 'freelance', '1099', 'W2'. Use one of these specific values: "Full-Time", "Contract", "Freelance". If it's unclear, default to "Full-Time".
          
          Example: \`{"applyUrl":"https://jobs.lever.co/company/123","jobDescription":"Responsible for data entry...","datePosted":"Posted 2 days ago","employmentType":"Contract"}\`

      *   **If you CANNOT find a live, valid link after searching:**
          If all links are dead, expired, or you cannot confidently verify an active posting, you MUST return ONLY the string "UNAVAILABLE".

      It is IMPOSSIBLE to find specific, active job postings this far in advance.
      Instead, your task is to use Google Search to identify COMPANIES that are likely to hire for these roles in the future.

      Search for companies that regularly hire for entry-level, fully remote roles in the US for ${searchInstruction}. Include companies that hire full-time employees, W-2 contractors, and 1099 freelancers.

      For each company you identify, find:
      1.  The company's name.
      2.  A helpful "hiringInsight": A piece of advice about their hiring patterns (e.g., "Frequently posts new full-time roles in the fall," or "Known for using 1099 contractors for project-based work.").
      3.  The main "careersUrl": The URL to their main careers or jobs page.

      CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
      - You MUST use Google Search to find this information.
      - DO NOT look for individual job application links.
      - Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting like \`\`\`json.
